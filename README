gizz
====

What is it?
-----------

gizz provides a command-line interface to some parts of the GitHub API in a
similar manner to the Launchpad plugin for Bazaar. The idea is to improve
integration between Git and GitHub from the command-line in specifc areas such
as handling pull requests and creating pull requests.

The goal is for gizz to improve the efficiency of the GitHub workflow so that
developers can spend less time on admin and more time hacking.

gizz is short for GitHub Whizz.

------------

gizz requires Python 3.2+. No other libraries are required.
